            <p>Rain, rain, rain. That's all I knew growing up in Seattle. Baseball practice? Muddy infield. Soccer game? No traction. Trip to the lake? Watch out for lightning.<br><br>
            Though I may never go back, I will always owe Seattle a debt for the lesson it taught me. Don't let the weather get you down.<br><br>
            My education and career began in healthcare. I reluctantly decided that medicine is not for me, and I am hard shifting into web development. I bring scientific thinking and problem solving skills to the table.</p>
